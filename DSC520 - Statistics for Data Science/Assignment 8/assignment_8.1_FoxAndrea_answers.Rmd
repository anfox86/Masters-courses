## Variable Significance

Originally, I ran glm(Risk1Yr ~ . , data = thoracic.data, family = 'binomial') to pull the logistic regression and figure out which variables were significant. In order to determine which variables were the most significant from my logical regression I used the p values. By looking for the p values that were below 0.05 I was able to determine that Pre9t, Pre14OC14, Pre17t, and Pre30t were all significant. These variables are: Pre9t - Dyspnoe before surgery, Pre14OC14 - size of original tumor (largest), Pre17t - Type 2 DM - diabetes mellitus, and Pre30t - Smoking.
  
## Accuracy

After running my variables through confusion matrix and then looking at accuracy PRE9 and PRE17 were the most accurate at 93% and 92%. The others failed miserably.
